1. Uses machine learning to predict how effective short antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) are at killing or inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms like bacteria, fungi or viruses.
2. AMPs are small proteins found in many organisms that have natural antimicrobial properties. However, testing each peptide for its effectiveness in a lab can be time-consuming and expensive.
3. Using known data about the properties of different AMPs(like their amino acid sequence, charge, structure), Goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate how well a new AMP will work, based on its features.
